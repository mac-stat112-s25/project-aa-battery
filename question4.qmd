# Simple scatterplot + trendline

  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "#E63946", size = 1.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Runtime and Worldwide Sales",
    subtitle = "Each point is a movie, with a trendline",
    x = "Runtime (Minutes)",
    y = "Worldwide Sales (Log Scale)"

  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 22, hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),
    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10))
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10", labels = scales::dollar)
```

After also running a Pearson correlation analysis only a weak-to-moderate positive relationship (r = 0.297) between runtime and worldwide sales was noticed, suggesting that longer movies tend to perform slightly better at the box office, although runtime alone is not a strong predictor of success.
