We will try to determine what makes movies successful at the box office, and how those factors have changed over time. We are passionate about movies and curious about what distinguishes high-earning movies from low-earning movies.\nWork Plan: We plan to share the workload as evenly as possible, and each work on several explorations of different variables of the data.",
