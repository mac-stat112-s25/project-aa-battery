# Patterns of Movie Box Office Success

This repository is an exploration of data from the top 1000 highest-grossing movies. The dataset we used 
is "Top 1000 Highest Grossing Movies", published to kaggle by Sanjeet Singh Naik. It pulls movie data from 
a variety of sites, including IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. The dataset was last updated on September 25th, 
2023.

The software required to run this code is RStudio version 2024.12.1+563 and R version 4.4.3.

In order to run this code, R and RStudio must be installed, as well as GitHub Desktop. The repository must 
be opened in GitHub desktop before being opened in RStudio.

The expected output of this code is four data visualizations: two boxplots, one column plot, and one 
dotplot.
